      <ul>
        <li class="question">
        <a>What platform do you boost on</a>
        <p>Currently on PC. I'll be looking to expand to consoles in the future if the demand is high enough.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="question">
        <a>What times do you normally boost from</a>
        <p>I boost from 05:00-15:00GMT, with additional time put in afterwards depending on the day.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="question">
        <a>Do you boost in solo, duo or squads?</a>
        <p>Currently I'm mainly boosting solo due to being the sole booster of the website,
          however I may do a few duo/squad games depending on the time of day (however if you'd prefer purely solo that can be easily arranged)</p>
        </li>
        <li class="question">
        <a>How will I know the progress of my order?</a>
        <p>You'll be able to contact me at all times on the status of your order and I will keep you informed</p>
        </li>
        <li class="question">
        <a>How is the wins service carried out?</a>
        <p>I will play the amount of games needed to get you the required wins, with a win rate of +50% it can be done suprisingly quick</p>

        <ul>
          <li class="question">
          <a>How secure/private will my account be</a>
          <p>Given that I'm the only person boosting you will not have to worry about having anyone other than me with access to your details.
            I also have completed numerous orders and have yet to hear or have anyone that has had their account banned</p>
          </li>
          <li class="question">
          <a>Can I play on the account while boosting?</a>
          <p>If you wish to play during the boost times 05:00-15:00GMT, we can set it up. It may add additional time to the service depending on the service.</p>
          </li>

      <div class="payment">
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <ul>
        <li class="question">
        <a>Is paypal your only method of recieving payments?</a>
        <p>Currently I only accept paypal. However I'll be looking at other payment options in the near future.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="question">
        <a>How do you charge for your leveling service that costs 500+ Euros?</a>
        <p>I split the 1-65 and 1-85 levels into sections as such you will pay the amount divided into 4 sections each for 1-35, 35-50, 50-60, 60-65 totalling the same amount as the 1-65 price.
          This is purely to satisfy customers to ensure that you are getting the order you paid for </p>
